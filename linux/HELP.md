**Gameplay Instructions**
=========================


1) Jump on boxes to increase score and gain boost. Boost direction will depend upon orientation of box.

2) Avoid the spike

3) Use the trampoline to jump higher than usual.

4) There is a ~5% chance that a shiny green box will appear. Destroy it to gain an invincibility powerup. It lasts for 5 seconds and provides immunity to spikes, higher jumps, allows the ball to pass through boxes and increases the score gained per box killed.

5) Water provides a viscous force and makes it harder to move. Collision with the water semisphere's boundaries makes the ball move dependending on the normal vector at point of collision.

6) Press `P` at any time to pause the game.

7) In case a spike kills you the game will stop. Press `R` to restart. You can restart in the middle of a game also, but your score will be reset to zero.

8) Magnet will apply an attractive force along X axis.

9) Score can be viewed in the title bar (make sure fullscreen is off).

10) Press `Q` or `ESC` at any time to quit the game.
